# IronPython_HFSS
Some IronPython code for :
1) automation of geometry building during RF Tag project
2) Adding a variable to a RF TAg that is imported from the native library and which does not natively allow to change the spire number into variable for further optimization
3) Some automations which will make the RF TAg geometry easier to build (for example Duplicate along line while increasing the size of element depending on the element number)
